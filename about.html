           <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Massimo. I'm a grade 9 student at St Thomas Highschool. This is my first coding project. I have been playing fortnite all the way back to season 1. A few of my other hobbies besides from gaming include listening to music, playing basketball and sneakers.</p>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <P>I chose to make a website about this game because I've always had a passion for it. The goal of this website was to see my level of coding by making a whole website about a topic</P>
